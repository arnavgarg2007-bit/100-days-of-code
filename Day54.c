//Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

    scanf("%d", &n);

    int total = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    int x = -1;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int left = i * (i + 1) / 2;
        int right = total - (i - 1) * i / 2;
